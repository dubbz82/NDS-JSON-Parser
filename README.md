# NDS-JSON-Parser
This is a simple frontend for NightYoshi370's NDS Api.  Typing in a valid 4 digit alphanumeric character code will pull the information for a game and display it.

# Thanks
Thanks to RocketRobz, ahezard, shutterbug2000 and the countless others that have contributed to the nds-bootstrap and twilightmenu projects.  Additionally a huge thanks to those that have contributed to the compatibility spreadsheet.  Without you there would be no data for this program to pull from.  Lastly but certainly not least, thanks to FlameKat53 for the icon.
