# NDS-JSON-Parser
This is a simple frontend for NightYoshi370's NDS Api.  Typing in a valid 4 digit alphanumeric character code or searching the title and clicking on the grid on the right hand side will pull the information for a game and display it.

# Thanks
Thanks to RocketRobz, ahezard, shutterbug2000 and the countless others that have contributed to the nds-bootstrap and twilightmenu projects.  Additionally a huge thanks to those that have contributed to the compatibility spreadsheet.  Without you there would be no data for this program to pull from.  Lastly but certainly not least, thanks to FlameKat53 for the icon.  

# Dependencies
Should you want to build this on your own, you'll need Visual Studio 2017 and will need to have System.Json installed (from Package Manager, use Install-Package System.Json -Version 4.5.0.  This may also be buildable on Linux, however I haven't personally tried doing this, as I don't have an environment set up for this.  If anyone wants to try this and can provide detailed instructions on the setup, I'll gladly add them here...
